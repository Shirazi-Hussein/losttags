**User Tags is currently a work in progress as we move from a full stack Django approach to React and Django REST. Estimated release date is 9/5.**

# User Tags

User Tags is a website dedicated to helping you get in touch with long lost friends that abandoned their online accounts.

## How it works

User Tags is a two party system; requiring the user searching and the user being searched to both use the platform.
This approach makes sure to respect the privacy of all parties involved, and for users who don't want to be found to have 
that opportunity.

### Filing a tag

Once you sign up and fill out any relevant information users may recognize you from, your ready to file a tag. Username, platform links, 
console, time met, and any additional information of the user you're looking for can be filed and submitted into our database, which 
is readily viewable to everyone. Once submitted, anyone can view your profile and contact information to reach out to.

### Finding a tag

The database updates in real time, with a search function to look up a tag via username, platform or time submitted. If you spot your username
on a tag, you can view the submitters information and get in touch with their contact information linked on their profile.
